## General Information
_Overdrive_ is a game where 2 car bots compete in a racing event. Each player will have a car bot and each bot will compete with each other to reach the finish line and win the match. In order to win the match, each player must implement a certain strategy to be able to beat his opponent.

Our task here is to implement a car bot in the game _'Overdrive'_ with the use Greedy algorithm strategy to win the game. To implement With these bots, students are advised to use the available game engine and continue developing the program written in the starter-bots at in starter-pack.

This Overdrive car bot implementation program was developed in Java language. The game specification that was used to build this bot is based on the [game rules]{https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2020-Overdrive/blob/develop/game-engine/game-rules.md) that is provided on _'Overdrive'_ game engine.


## Technologies Used
The whole car bot implementation program was written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA.
